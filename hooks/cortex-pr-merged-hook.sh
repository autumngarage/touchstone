# hooks/cortex-pr-merged-hook.sh — auto-draft a Cortex `pr-merged` Journal
# entry after a PR squash-merges to the default branch.
#
# Implements Cortex Protocol § 2 Tier-1 trigger T1.9 ("Pull request merged
# to the default branch"). When a project has both Touchstone and Cortex
# installed, this hook fires from `merge-pr.sh` immediately after the
# remote merge succeeds and the local default branch is synced. It shells
# out to `cortex journal draft pr-merged --no-edit`, captures the new
# entry's path on stdout, stages it, commits with `--no-verify` (so the
# auto-commit doesn't recurse through any other default-branch hooks),
# and pushes a single follow-up commit to the default branch.
#
# Activation contract (ALL of these must hold; otherwise silent exit 0):
#   1. Push target is the default branch (main or master). Resolved by
#      asking `gh repo view`.
#   2. The repo has a `.cortex/` directory at the same level as `.git/`.
#   3. The `cortex` CLI is on $PATH.
#   4. `.touchstone-config` has `cortex_pr_merged_hook=auto` or `=on`.
#      Default for newly-bootstrapped projects: `auto`. Value `off`
#      disables. Missing key is treated as `auto` (so projects that
#      haven't migrated yet still benefit when the other gates pass).
#
# Failure modes (no silent failures past activation):
#   - cortex missing mid-flow (between detection and exec): log to stderr
#     and exit 0 (degrade gracefully — don't fail the merge because the
#     CLI was uninstalled in a tiny race window).
#   - `cortex journal draft` exits non-zero: stderr surfaced, exit 1.
#   - Empty stdout (no path returned): stderr message, exit 1.
#   - Returned path doesn't exist after the call: stderr message, exit 1.
#   - `git commit` or `git push` failure: stderr message, exit 1.
#
# Inputs (env, all optional):
#   TOUCHSTONE_MERGED_PR        — PR number to thread through to the
#                                 commit message (e.g. supplied by
#                                 merge-pr.sh after `gh pr merge`).
#   TOUCHSTONE_CORTEX_HOOK_DISABLE
#                               — set to 1/true/on to short-circuit even
#                                 when config says auto/on. Useful for
#                                 tests that want to verify a path
#                                 without firing the writer.
#   TOUCHSTONE_DEFAULT_BRANCH   — override the default-branch lookup
#                                 (the test fixture sets this so it
#                                 doesn't need a configured GitHub remote).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — fired and committed; OR silently skipped (inactive); OR cortex
#       went missing mid-flow (graceful degrade).
#   1 — activated and a real failure occurred (journal draft failed,
#       commit/push failed, missing path).
