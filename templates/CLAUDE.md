# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Claude Code Instructions

## Who You Are on This Project

{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION — describe the project's purpose, your role, and what "good" looks like for this codebase. Be specific about the domain.}}

## Git Workflow

@principles/git-workflow.md

### The lifecycle (drive this automatically, do not ask the user for permission at each step)

1. **Pull.** `git pull --rebase` on the default branch before starting work.
2. **Branch.** `git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>` where `<type>` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`.
3. **Change + commit.** Make the code change, stage explicit file paths, commit with a concise message.
4. **Ship.** `bash scripts/open-pr.sh --auto-merge` — pushes, creates the PR, runs AI review, squash-merges, and syncs the default branch in one step.
5. **Clean up.** `git branch -D <feature-branch>` if it still exists locally.

### Housekeeping

- Concise commit messages. Logically grouped changes.
- Run `/compact` at ~50% context. Start fresh sessions for unrelated work.

### Memory Hygiene

- Treat Claude Code memory as cached guidance, not canonical truth. Before relying on a remembered command, flag, path, version, or workflow, verify it against this repo.
- Do not write memory for facts that are cheap to derive from `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.toolkit-config`, release docs, or the code itself.
- If you write memory that mentions a command, flag, file path, version, release process, or "current/primary" workflow, include the date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and the canonical source checked.
- If memory conflicts with the repo, follow the repo and ask to audit or update the stale memory.

## Testing

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies without rerunning the full machine setup
bash setup.sh --deps-only

# Before any push — uses .toolkit-config profile defaults and command overrides
bash scripts/toolkit-run.sh validate
```

Fix failing tests before pushing.

## Release & Distribution

{{RELEASE_AND_DISTRIBUTION — how is this project shipped? Include the release command, package registry or deployment target, required version bump, post-release verification, and rollback path. Examples: Homebrew tap, npm package, Docker image, Vercel/Railway deploy, app store build.}}

After merging release-affecting changes, verify the shipped artifact or deployed environment matches the pushed code.

## Architecture

{{ARCHITECTURE — describe key packages, their responsibilities, and how data flows between them. Keep it high-level.}}

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| {{key files and their purposes}} | |

## State & Config

{{STATE_AND_CONFIG — where does mutable state live? What's gitignored? Where's the config template?}}

## Hard-Won Lessons

{{HARD_WON_LESSONS — bugs that cost real time or money. Each should teach a generalizable lesson. Format: what happened, what was the root cause, what's the fix/guard now in place.}}
